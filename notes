- Check the HTTP_REFERER value is from https://payment.ipay88.com.my (only applicable if the merchant web site is working with SSL Certificate).?

- Ensure to implement a check to determine either "response page" or "backend page" to update the order so it won't update order status in DAPP system more than 1 time.
Note: After receiving the payment success status, SWAPZ will simultaneously return payment status to "response page" and "backend page".

Do we want to update requery logic? (check ipay88 flowchart) And also ipay88 is a GET API not POST

Response need sample?
